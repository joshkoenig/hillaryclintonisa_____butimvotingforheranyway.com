# Hillary Clinton Is "Meh" But I'm Voting for Her Anyway

Like you, I find the prospect of voting for Hillary Clinton somewhat depressing. I am among those who feel they are #ReluctantlyWithHer. She seems to be a poor communicator, often appears insincere or opportunistic, and I am opposed to many of her current and historical policy positions, particularly with regards to trade and foreign policy. 

I'm further discouraged by the elitist and sometimes condescending of her campaign throughout the primaries, and by the tendency for some of her supporters and surrogates to ascribe any reservations about her candidacy to sexism or GOP propaganda. There are legitimate reasons to prefer 

However, we are where we are, and given the stakes in this election, I am absolutely voting for Hillary Clinton in spite of my reservations. In fact, as I started to think about the situation more deeply, and re-examined many of my reactions to Secretary Clinton as a candiate, I found myself feeling less and less reluctant, and more and more enthusiastic. Not only for the candidate herself, but for the opportunity her election would present.

I created this website as a record of this thought process, and as a candid attempt to convince others to walk the same path. To go from reluctance (or worse; bitter indifference, for instance) to enthusiasm. 

My argument will come in four parts. First and most obvious given the name of this site, I'll explain how I overcame my reservations, and make the positive case for voting for Clinton in light of my conerns. Secondly, I will make the case for being engaged in this political cycle rather than getting bummed and dropping out. Thirdly, I will explain why this is not a good time to vote for a third party. Last but not least I will remind everyone what's at stake in this election; if all else has failed, I hope that will spur you to action.

The case I make may or may not resonate with you, but if it does, I urge you to do more than vote, to actively encourage or organize your friends, family, neighbors and co-workers to engage as well. If we believe our politics matter and that elections have consequences — and if you're reading this and I wrote this, I think we can assume we do — we must remember that voting is not the ultimate political act in a democracy. 

If we care about the outcome this cycle and beyond, voting is the least we can do.
