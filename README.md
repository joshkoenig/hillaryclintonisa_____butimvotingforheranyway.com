### About

This is a repository of short political arguments in support of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run. They are meant to appeal to people who are disaffected with her as a candidate, but who are probably aligned with some of her policies. It's meant to "get people over the hump" and see the potential upside of President Clinton.

### History

I [worked professionally](http://blogs.harvard.edu/lydondev/2003/12/04/music-for-america-sountrack-of-the-transformation/) on the 2004 presidential cycle in one of the first overt efforts to organize and turn out "millennial voters," a novel phrase at the time. Perhaps I'm falling victim to the human tendency to relive one's glory days, but it seems that some of the dynamics today's 2016 contest are reminiscent of that race.

Circa 2004 George W Bush was still broadly popular, but to younger voters he presented much to organize "against", from his initiation of war in Iraq to his alliance with regressive anti-equality social forces. The stakes were high. However, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, was problematic. A compromising, uncharismatic, centrist career politician with a cerebral style and deep establishment roots, his campaign struggled to create a digestible message capable of energizing the electorate, and had difficulty fending off negative attacks and narratives from both the right and the left.

Around this point in that cycle, a website appeared with a series of short essays which I personally found very helpful. They frankly acknowledged the shortcomings of Kerry as a candidate while underlining the importance of pulling the lever for him nevertheless. The website was called "[John Kerry is a Douchebag but I'm Voting for Him Anyway](https://web.archive.org/web/20040723070151/http://www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com/)."

In that same spirit, I want to make a pragmatic case for voting Clinton, even though she's a flawed candidate. This repository will be where I construct the arguments. Though I've decided that the "#ReluctantlyWithHer" slogan is the catchiest, and makes a better domain name, I'm keeping the subheading "Hillary Clinton is 'Meh' But I'm Voting for Her Anyway" as an homage to that original inspiration.

Pull requests are welcome.
