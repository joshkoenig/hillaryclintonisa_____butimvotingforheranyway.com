## Overturning Citizens United With A National Wave

My positive vision is not one of what Clinton can do for us, but about her potential as a vehicle for organization towards change. Her candidacy itself is a moderate affair with limited upside, but I can envision her *presidency* as providing the conditions for more meaningful impacts. This is the "best case scenario" for her victory.

The neoliberal consensus which Clinton symbolizes is unraveling, just as the GOP's core coalition is coming apart. We're likely to see a lot of reorganization of our politics over the next few cycles as baby boomers begin to age out of leadership roles. Having the next four years (or more) be characterized by advancing an agenda and building a movement which is able to achieve results will provide fertile ground for a next generation to emerge.

In a period of realignment, it's a lot better to play offense.

The best case scenario for this fall is that not only does Clinton prevail, but that she does so as part of an elevated level of turnout which reverses control of the Senate, and narrows the GOP House majority. This would likely lead to a breakdown of organized and disciplined opposition, and create a window of opportunity to advance broadly popular legislation.

## Back to a 50-State Strategy

To me, Clinton's most exciting campaign promise is to [introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United][1]. This is vital if we want to reduce the political influence of corporations and the hyper-wealthy. What's more, passing a constitutional amendment requires a nationwide referendum in which 38 out of 50 states must ratify the change. That means we'll need to build a serious 50-state strategy once again.

Coupling the policy gain of fixing campaign finance with a 50-state organizational opportunity is a huge potential win, especially going into a midterm cycle, or even into a tough 2020 re-election race which will also put a number of state legislatures (and ergo the post-census redistricting process) in play. Much like the GOP used a wave of same-sex marriage bans to drive their supporters out in 2004, we could use an anti-corporate-money wave to drive ours.

This kind of operation cannot be managed by a President, or even by the Democratic party. It requires a broader people-powered coalition, providing a golden opportunity for a "do over" on 2008: we can put a candidate over the top, and continue organizing to keep that candidate (and others) motivated to fulfill their mandate.

This is the kind of organization which could grow in strength through a period of political realignment, maturing into a meaningful and enduring vehicle for positive change. It would get things done nationally, while also achieving wins at the state and local level.

Is it the most likely outcome of electing Hillary Clinton? No. But it's a lot more realistic than thinking we can blow it all up and start over, or that protest alone can deliver change. It will take a lot of work and probably some luck, but ultimately we must realize that the positive potential of democracy doesn't begin and end at the ballot box, and practice the art of controlling our environment.

President Clinton will provide much better future conditions for improving the world than the alternative. On that basis, any progressive should be able to cast her or his vote for Hillary with a clean conscience, and perhaps even a spark of enthusiasm.

## Or, Like I Said Before

Also, remember that a different court can hear a different case and overturn the whole thing. There's precedent for this in our history too. The shameful doctrine of "separate but equal" came from a [1896 Supreme Court Decision upholding segregation], which lasted for 60 years until being corrected during the Civil Rights movement.

Indeed, *Citizens United* is itself a bit of a reversal of a 2003 case, and there are many more examples of this happening as the SCOTUS changes composition. This is a more direct (and perhaps more likely) route to reducing the influence of big spenders, though it doesn't come with the same grassroots infrastructure benefits.

## Shifting Gears

The latter essays I have are arguments about why *not* to do things. They're perhaps a little less powerful, but also necessary. If you are feeling like you might go this way, or know people who are, then these are for you:

*   [Don't Drop Out][3]
*   [Remember The Stakes][4]
