This one is still a work in progress. I want to take the lessons of the Brexit vote, in particular how screwed younger voters were that they didn't show up in larger numbers. I believe this was in large part due to the fact that the Remain campaign (the analog to Clinton, vs Trump as the "Leave" faction) did a really poor job.

The lesson is not to wait for leaders of questionable ability to do the job of making the case. Politics is the art of controlling your environment. When we feel we're not getting the leadership we want, we should step up and be that leadership.
