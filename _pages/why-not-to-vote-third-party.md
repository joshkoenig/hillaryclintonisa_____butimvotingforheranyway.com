When you actually dig in on these people, they aren't very credible. Also, given the rules of how democracy works it's not going to do anything. Don't make the same mistake I did in 2000.

## A Personal Story

I cast my first presidential ballot in 2000 for Ralph Nader. It was ok. I lived in New York City, voting in an ultra-safe state. I believed that Al Gore and George W Bush were like [Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v7XXSt9XRM). When Bush won his case in the Supreme Court and became president my opinion was like, "whatever man, just another white-bread corporate overlord." 

The point is, I didn't feel even the slightest bit of remorse over my principled vote for my conscience. For what its worth I also didn't see any signs that the Democratic party was about to listen to the Nader voters and start tracking to the left, but again, whatever. After the election I went back to living my life as a college student at NYU.

And then, 9/11. Maybe you saw that coming. I didn't.

Disclaimer: I'm reluctant to use the terrorist attacks in political arguments — the way they were abused as symbols in the following years is still deeply sickening to me. It's a touchy subject. 

I want to be clear that I'm in no way suggesting that anything like that will happen again in the next four years. I'm not trying to scaremonger on anyone. But this cronology of events is essential to the truth of my story.

Elections have consequences, which I learned the hard way. If you were young at the time, you might not remember all the details. Suffice to say, Bush and his whole squad took the moment and _ran with it_. We're still paying for that now, and likely will continue to do so for years to come.

For all I thought about Al Gore, in retrospect there's no way he would have whipped up invading Iraq in the aftermath. Thinking back, I don't regret my vote in New York (again, inconsequential). What I regret with my 20/20 hindsight is not getting on a bus, going to Florida, and organizing. 

I could probably have gotten 538 net new voters to the polls. There was a real act I could have taken that could have made a powerful difference. That's when I started paying more attention and getting more engaged in activism with a pragmatic perspective, something that's stuck with me ever since.

What I learned is that politics matter in more specific and mundane ways than I'd appreciated. Marginal differences have a huge impact when there's a lot of power behind them. I also learned that you're not just voting for a President - you're voting for an _administration_, for a whole squad of players, and a way of doing things that even under normal conditions will have ripple effects far beyond what the individual at the top does or doesn't do.

So, that's why I'm not likely to ever vote for a third party candidate for any office where they don't have a real shot of winning. Protest voting doesn't actually do anything, and I know that none of the people we elect weild power are perfect, and that even a small difference in temperment, outlook, and agenda will impact lives.

## The Practical Problem With Third Parties

There is currently no viable third party in the United States that can shift our politics at the national level. The Green and Libertarian Parties have no popular base of support: they are not effective at electing people to local or state government. They organize almost exclusively around running presidential candidates, and they tend to appeal exclusively to narrow demographic groups, even compared to the GOP.

As [Dan Savage so eloquently put it](http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/07/19/24362128/dan-savage-on-jill-stein-just-no), you don't start at the biggest election:

<blockquote>
If you're interested in building a third party, a viable third party, you don’t start with president. You don't start by running someone for fucking president.

Where are the Green Party candidates for city councils? For county councils? For state legislatures? For state assessor? For state insurance commissioner? For governor? For fucking dogcatcher? I would be SO willing to vote for Green Party candidates who are starting at the bottom, grassroots, bottom up, building a third party, a viable third party.
</blockquote>

He also makes a good point about whose interests are on the line in most elections:

<blockquote>
And the people who’ll suffer are not going to be the pasty white Green Party supporters — pasty white Jill Stein and her pasty white supporters. The people who’ll suffer are going to be people of color. People of minority faiths. Queer people. Women.

Don’t do it. Don't throw your vote away on Jill Stein/vote for, bankshot-style, Donald Trump.
</blockquote>

The Greens and Libertarians are bad at tactics. What they do is capture dissatisfaction with the status quo and offer citizens the opportunity to cast a "protest vote." What this accomplishes is anyone's guess; there's no historical example or credible theory I know of that ties protest voting to actual change, though there are examples of opposition actively funding and encouraging protest voting to increase the chances of the third party playing spoiler.

There's a reason they almost exclusively harnass the energy of relatively privileged people. Not just white voters, but relatively affluent and educated white voters. We have (or at least feel we have) very little personally at stake these contests. Protest voting might have no impact (or might even be counter-productive) but it makes the voter feel better, and there's no real personal downside. 

Likewise anyone who says "it'll have to get worse before it gets better." They don't often really think it'll get worse _for themselves_. If that describes anyone you know, try to do what you can to get them to think bigger.

There have been moments where new parties have had the potential to upend the two-party balance, the most recent being Perot's 1992 Reform Party ticket. Those are moments that shift the debate and can have a major impact. However, these moments tend to be fairly rare. This year is not one of those times.
