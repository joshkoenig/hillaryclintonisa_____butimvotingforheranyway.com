Like you, I find the prospect of voting for Hillary Clinton somewhat depressing. [#ImReluctantlyWithHer][1]. She seems to be a poor communicator, often appears insincere or opportunistic, and I am opposed to many of her current and historical policy positions, particularly with regards to trade and foreign policy.

I've been further discouraged by the elitist and sometimes condescending tone of her campaign throughout the primaries, and by the tendency for some of her supporters and surrogates to ascribe any reservation about her candidacy to sexism or GOP propaganda. All of this combines to leave me feeling pretty "meh" about the prospect of giving her my vote.

However, we are where we are, and given the stakes in this election, I am absolutely going to vote for Hillary Clinton, in spite of my reservations. In fact, as I started to think about the situation more deeply, and re-examined many of my reactions to her as a candiate, I found myself feeling less and less reluctant, and ultimately even a little optimistic. Not only for the candidate herself, but for the opportunity her election would present.

I created this website as a record of my thought process, and as a candid attempt to convince others to walk the same path. To go from reluctance (or worse; bitter indifference) to enthusiasm, tempered with doubt though it may be.

My argument will come in four parts. First and most obvious given the name of this site, I'll explain how I overcame my reservations, and make the positive case for voting for Hillary Clinton in light of my conerns. I believe it's imperative to make the case in terms of "voting for" someone.

Secondly, I will make the case for being engaged in this political cycle rather than getting bummed and dropping out. Even if you don't end up with a spark of innate interest in what a Clinton victory could mean, there are many other reasons to remain engaged and show up to vote this November.

Thirdly, I will explain why even if you feel the need to protest what centrist Democrats stand for, this is not a good time to vote for a third party. There are more powerful ways to lodge that protest which have a better chance of making a dent.

Last but not least I will remind everyone what's at stake in this election, in terms that you might not normally be thinking. If all else has failed, I hope that will spur you to action.

The case I make may or may not resonate with you, but if it does, I urge you to actually do more than vote. Trudging to the polls to cast a reluctant vote is no way to live a political life. There's plenty to be inspired about or by, and plenty of reasons to actively encourage or organize your friends, family, neighbors and co-workers to engage as well.

If we believe our politics matter and that elections have consequences — and if you're reading this and I wrote this, I think we can assume we do — we must remember that voting is not the ultimate political act in a democracy. Politics is the art of controlling your environment, so participate fully! If we care about the outcome this cycle and beyond, voting is the least we can do.
