## This Is Not A Drill

I am not a fan of compelling people to vote for someone because of how bad their opponent will be. That's why I make all the positive arguments â€” President Clinton would do some good, and provide a good playing field for organizing for better things. However, recognizing the stakes in this election is part of the equation.

Trump would be a disaster of some kind or another. Best case scenario is he's a totally ineffective joker. Medium case scenario is he acts like 10x the jackass George W was, stokes a bunch of racial resentment, and lets his theocratic VP Mike Pence run policy. Bad but still pretty conceivable case is he's like Nixon on steroids. Worst case... well, it could get very dark indeed.

Rooting for disaster is a deeply irresponsible thing to do. People who want to "burn it down" tend to be people who assume they'll be able to get out the fire exit. People who say "it has to get worse before it gets better" somehow are also the people for whom it won't *actually* get much worse.

## Scenarios

If you feel the need to use the stick instead of the carrot, here are my top concerns with a Trump presidency. I've grouped them by degree of likelihood. Depending on your temperament (or that of whoever you're attempting to sway) you may find the more or less extreme/likely considerations resonate. Feel free to preach your own dark future as well. There's plenty of material to work from.

### Virtually Certain Calamity

Here are a things that are guaranteed to happen if Donald Trump becomes president:

*   A Supreme Court favoring corporate interests for 20+ years.
*   White Nationalists will be emboldened.
*   Paul Ryan would be unleashed to start cutting benefits.
*   Progressives will be playing defense across the board.

Basically, it'll guarantee we miss a window of opportunity to move our national politics in the right direction; a serious step backward, with likely negative consequences for people who are currently on the margins of society.

### Highly Likely Crises

While not guaranteed to go down, there are a number of additional concerns I have which I feel are likely:

*   Economic turmoil, widening inequality, reduced retirement security. Not a collapse, but confusion and uncertainty, which will inhibit economic growth.
*   An increase of racially motivated violence, from schoolyard bullying to mass shooting events. 
*   US disengagement from current global climate efforts, increasing the odds that India and China also disengage.
*   More collateral damage from airstrikes as rules of engagement loosen.

Injecting Trump's personality into the national psyche has already had negative consequences. Giving him the power of the President would amplify all those effects, creating a lot of chaos. The best will lack conviction and the worst will be full of passionate intensity.

### My Dark Future

I don't really think that Trump would do anything stupid with the nuclear codes, but there's lethal damage to be done without having to go that far. For instance:

*   National surveillance (NSA, etc) is weaponized and used against political opponents, allowing Trump to quash the left and consolidate power over the GOP.
*   Further powers are enacted to allow the criminalization/suppression of speech online. 
*   Recession hits (this is structurally likely no matter who is elected) and unemployment among the Trumpen Proletariat spikes.
*   Grassroots militia organizations are encouraged and subsidized. Militarization of police forces increases significantly.
*   Some kind of large terror event.
*   ...

It's hard not to see Trump as a narcissistic brute, and hard not to imagine him doing everything in his power to expand and maintain his power. He'll have a lot of tools at his disposal, and it's naive to assume he won't figure out how to use at least a few of them. If he's got some deviously competent staffers/advisors and a little luck, it could be pretty bad indeed.
